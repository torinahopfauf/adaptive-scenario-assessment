### Scenario 1: Alien Invasion Negotiation (Question 1)

Aliens arrive on Earth and are interested—but unsure—about investing in Earth's global culture. They've seen impressive culinary offerings on other planets, like edible crystals and glowing beverages. During initial discussions, your alien contact is skeptical and asks:

**"Earth cuisine seems underwhelming. Some planets offer edible crystals and glowing beverages. What culinary advantage could Earth possibly have?"**

How will you respond?

A. "Our food might seem ordinary—but we have chicken nuggets shaped like dinosaurs. Nobody else in this galaxy merges poultry and paleontology."

B. "Can you tell me more about what culinary experiences impressed you on other planets, and what your group seeks most in galactic cuisine?"

C. "Forget cuisine. Our themed cookware merchandise and cooking shows clearly surpass edible crystals and glowing beverages."

D. "You're wrong there, alien friends! We exclusively eat glowing lunar moss sandwiches and edible diamond soups."

### Scenario 2: The Cheesy Startup (Question 1)

Your online exotic cheese startup, "Cheesy Wonders," must compete with traditional local cheese shops. A potential large corporate client, Cheese Sandwich Inc., is reluctant to shift from local suppliers due to concerns about freshness. On your call, they directly express concern:

**"Your cheeses look exciting, but we're skeptical about freshness and delivery reliability compared to established local cheese shops. Why risk buying cheeses online?"**

How will you respond?

A. "Freshness? Wait until you see our custom-developed cheese-drones—tiny remote-controlled helicopters that individually deliver cheese directly onto plates!"

B. "You prefer driving across town in rain and traffic jams to pick up cheese? Evolution clearly favors innovation over inconveniences—do you want to be left behind?"

C. "Freshness and reliability matter most to you. Would it help if I share detailed data showing our temperature-controlled supply chain and specific logistics processes we use?"

D. "Freshness probably isn't even a huge issue; cheese is cheese, and most customers can't tell the difference anyway."
