<h2>Scenario 2: The Cheesy Startup</h2>
<p>Your exotic cheese startup "Cheesy Wonders" markets rare and premium cheeses online. Space Sandwich Inc. expresses skepticism:</p>
<blockquote>"We're interested, but we're concerned about reliability and freshness online. Local markets guarantee these aspects clearly—how does an online supplier ensure consistent freshness?"</blockquote>

<p><strong>How would you initially respond?</strong></p>
<button onclick="q1('A')">"We use comprehensive analytics and freshness-tracking logistics to ensure reliable premium quality."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('B')">"Can we clearly define exactly which freshness standards matter most to your company?"</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('C')">"Our innovative drone cheese delivery system ensures consistent freshness each time."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('D')">"Allow us to demonstrate explicitly how our process guarantees freshness."</button><br><br>
