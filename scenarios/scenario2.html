<h2>Scenario 2: The Cheesy Startup</h2>
<p>Your exotic cheese startup "Cheesy Wonders" markets rare and premium cheeses online. A major client, Space Sandwich Inc., voices skepticism about reliability and freshness:</p>
<blockquote>"We're intrigued, but delivering premium cheese reliably seems challenging. Local markets offer guaranteed freshness. How can an online provider genuinely match that?"</blockquote>

<p><strong>How would you respond initially to build confidence clearly?</strong></p>
<button onclick="q1('A')">"We offer cutting-edge freshness-tracking logistics analytics ensuring clear reliability."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('B')">"Would you describe specifically what freshness standards are crucial to you?"</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('C')">"Our cheese drone delivery system precisely assures freshness—with a touch of cheese innovation."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('D')">"Let us provide concrete demonstrations of our freshness guarantees in action."</button><br><br>
