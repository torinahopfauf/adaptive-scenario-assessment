<h2>Scenario 2: The Cheesy Startup</h2>
<p>Your exotic cheese startup, "Cheesy Wonders," markets rare premium cheeses online. A major potential client, Space Sandwich Inc., voices skepticism:</p>
<blockquote>"We're intrigued but concerned about reliability and freshness. Local cheese shops guarantee freshness easily; can an online vendor truly compete with that?"</blockquote>

<p><strong>How would you initially respond clearly and professionally?</strong></p>
<button onclick="q1('A')">"Our freshness analytics and advanced logistics tracking guarantee cheese arrives reliably fresh."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('B')">"Could you clearly define what freshness levels or criteria matter most to your standards?"</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('C')">"We deliver cheese using drones to ensure precise freshness levels at delivery."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('D')">"Allow us to demonstrate exactly and explicitly how we handle cheese freshness and reliability."</button><br><br>
