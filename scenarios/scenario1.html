<h2>Scenario 1: Alien Cuisine Negotiation</h2>
<p>An alien delegation arrives expressing cautious interest in investing in Earth's culinary sector, with some reservation:</p>
<blockquote>"Other planets we've visited offer impressive culinary products like edible crystal meals and glowing beverages. Earth's options appear comparatively mundane. What unique culinary advantage does Earth truly offer?"</blockquote>

<button onclick="q1('A')">"We have dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets creatively combined with Earth's unique history."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('B')">"Describe culinary experiences you've enjoyed on other planets, clarifying precisely your expectations."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('C')">"Our interactive cookware and culinary entertainment outshine galactic competitors clearly."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('D')">"Our advanced analytics measure dining satisfaction, clearly validating Earth's culinary strengths."</button><br><br>
