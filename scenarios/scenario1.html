<h2>Scenario 1: Alien Cuisine Negotiation</h2>
<p>An alien delegation arrives, expressing interest in Earth's culinary industry, but cautious due to skepticism:</p>
<blockquote>"Other planets have impressed us with culinary innovations like edible crystal meals and glowing drinks. Earth's cuisine seems comparatively unremarkable. Could you clearly explain Earth's unique culinary strength?"</blockquote>

<p><strong>How would you respond initially?</strong></p>
<button onclick="q1('A')">"We have dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets uniquely blending culinary creativity and historical appeal."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('B')">"Could you describe culinary experiences you've particularly valued elsewhere, clarifying your exact requirements?"</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('C')">"Our cookware merchandise and culinary entertainment significantly surpass competitor planets' offerings."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('D')">"We use advanced analytics tools that specifically measure dining satisfaction, clearly validating our approach."</button><br><br>
