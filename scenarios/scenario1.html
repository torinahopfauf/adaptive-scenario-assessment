    <h2>Scenario 1: Alien Cuisine Negotiation</h2>

    <p>Aliens arrive on Earth tentatively signaling interest—they're considering investing in Earth's global culture, but they're also secretly evaluating other planetary civilizations. You've set up your first meeting to better understand their cultural requirements and position Earth's uniqueness. During your initial discovery conversation, your alien contact says:</p>
    
    <blockquote><strong>"Earth cuisine seems underwhelming. Some planets offer edible crystals and glowing beverages. What culinary advantage could Earth possibly have?"</strong></blockquote>

    <button>A: "Our food might seem ordinary at first glance, but we have chicken nuggets shaped like dinosaurs. Nobody else in this galaxy thought about merging poultry and paleontology—that clearly makes us better."</button><br><br>

    <button>B: "Can you tell me more about what culinary experiences impressed you on other planets, and what your group seeks the most in galactic cuisine?"</button><br><br>
    
    <button>C: "You're worried about food? Forget cuisine! Our themed cookware merchandise lines and cooking shows alone clearly surpass any edible crystals or glowing beverages you've seen elsewhere."</button><br><br>
    
    <button>D: "You're very wrong there, alien friends! We exclusively eat glowing lunar moss sandwiches and edible diamond soups—our chefs simply weren't aware it would impress space visitors."</button><br><br>
