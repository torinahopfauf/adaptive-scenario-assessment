    <h2>Scenario 1: Alien Cuisine Negotiation</h2>
    <p>An alien delegation arrives considering investment in Earth's culinary landscape. Expressing hesitation, they state:</p>
    <blockquote>"We've experienced impressive culinary options on other planets, including edible crystals and glowing beverages. Comparatively, Earth's cuisine feels uninspired. What distinct culinary advantage does Earth truly offer?"</blockquote>
    <button onclick="q1('A')">"We offer uniquely shaped dinosaur chicken nuggets, creatively combining Earth's history and cuisine."</button><br><br>
    <button onclick="q1('B')">"Could you share culinary experiences you've appreciated previously, and clarify precisely what you're seeking now?"</button><br><br>
    <button onclick="q1('C')">"Our cookware merchandise and culinary entertainment significantly outperform competing planets."</button><br><br>
    <button onclick="q1('D')">"We offer advanced analytics that accurately measure dining satisfaction, clearly validating Earth's culinary success."</button><br><br>
