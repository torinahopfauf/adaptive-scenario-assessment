<h2>Scenario 1: Alien Cuisine Negotiation</h2>

<p>Aliens arrive on Earth tentatively signaling interest—they're considering investing in Earth's global culture, but they're also secretly evaluating other planetary civilizations. You've set up your first meeting to better understand their cultural requirements and position Earth's uniqueness. During your initial discovery conversation, your alien contact says:</p>

<blockquote><strong>"Earth cuisine seems underwhelming. Some planets offer edible crystals and glowing beverages. What culinary advantage could Earth possibly have?"</strong></blockquote>
