    <h2>Scenario 1: Alien Cuisine Negotiation</h2>
    <p>An alien delegation arrives, indicating potential interest in investing in Earth's culinary culture. However, they express skepticism:</p>
    <blockquote><em>"We've explored impressive culinary options elsewhere—edible crystal meals, luminous beverages, and more. Frankly, Earth's offerings seem less exciting in comparison. What distinct culinary advantage can Earth provide?"</em></blockquote>

    <button onclick="firstAnswer('A', false)">"We offer chicken nuggets shaped like dinosaurs—a unique combination of cuisine and Earth's paleontological history."</button><br><br>
    <button onclick="firstAnswer('B', true)">"Could you share what culinary experiences have impressed you previously, and specifically outline what you're seeking now?"</button><br><br>
    <button onclick="firstAnswer('C', false)">"Our cookware merchandise and food-related entertainment are clearly superior to competitors across the galaxy."</button><br><br>
    <button onclick="firstAnswer('D', true)">"We utilize advanced analytics to precisely measure dining satisfaction and preferences, clearly demonstrating our strengths."</button><br><br>
