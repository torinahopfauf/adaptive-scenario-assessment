<h2>Scenario 1: Alien Cuisine Negotiation</h2>
<p>An alien delegation arrives, considering an investment in Earth's culinary landscape but expressing initial skepticism:</p>
<blockquote>"We've encountered impressive culinary options on other planets—edible crystals, glowing beverages. Comparatively, Earth's cuisine seems somewhat ordinary. Can you clarify Earth's unique culinary advantage?"</blockquote>

<button onclick="q1('A')">"Our chicken nuggets shaped like dinosaurs uniquely merge Earth's history and culinary creativity."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('B')">"Could you describe culinary experiences you've appreciated previously, clarifying what you seek now?"</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('C')">"Earth's cookware merchandise and entertainment clearly outperform galactic competitors."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('D')">"Advanced analytics tools precisely measure dining satisfaction, validating our culinary methods."</button><br><br>
