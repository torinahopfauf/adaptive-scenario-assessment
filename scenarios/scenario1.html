<h2>Scenario 1: Alien Cuisine Negotiation</h2>
<p>An alien delegation arrives, cautiously interested in investing in Earth's culinary sector but expresses reservations:</p>
<blockquote>"We've encountered impressive culinary offerings on other planets, such as edible crystal meals and glowing beverages. Comparatively, Earth's culinary products seem ordinary. What exactly is Earth's unique culinary advantage?"</blockquote>

<p><strong>How would you initially respond to their concern?</strong></p>
<button onclick="q1('A')">"We offer dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets, a creative blend of Earth's history and culinary innovation."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('B')">"Can we discuss the culinary experiences you've valued on other planets and clearly define what you seek in Earth's offerings?"</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('C')">"Our culinary merchandise and interactive entertainment surpass other planets' products distinctly."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="q1('D')">"Our analytics tools specifically measure culinary satisfaction, clearly validating Earth's unique approach."</button><br><br>
