  <h2>Scenario 1: Alien Cuisine Negotiation</h2>
  
  <p>Aliens arrive interested but concerned about Earth's culinary offerings compared to other planets' glowing food. They ask: "What culinary advantage could Earth possibly have?"</p>

  <button>A: Dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets uniquely merging cuisine and Earth's culture/history.</button><br><br>
  <button>B: Please clarify in detail what your group values most to clearly align our culinary offerings.</button><br><br>
  <button>C: Our cooking-themed shows and kitchen merchandise clearly outperform competitor offerings, and we can demonstrate this.</button><br><br>
  <button>D: We have analytic tools clearly measuring and demonstrating client satisfaction objectivelyâ€”would reviewing these help assure you?</button><br><br>

  <!-- (We will add adaptive branching logic soon, for now just scenario clearly displayed correctly) -->
