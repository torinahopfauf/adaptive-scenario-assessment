       <h2>Scenario 1: Alien Invasion Negotiation</h2>

<p>Aliens arrive on Earth and are interested—but unsure—about investing in Earth's global culture. They've seen impressive culinary offerings on other planets, like edible crystals and glowing beverages. During initial discussions, your alien contact is skeptical and asks:</p>

<p><strong>"Earth cuisine seems underwhelming. Some planets offer edible crystals and glowing beverages. What culinary advantage could Earth possibly have?"</strong></p>

<button onclick="selectAnswer('A')">A. "Our food might seem ordinary—but we have chicken nuggets shaped like dinosaurs. Nobody else in this galaxy merges poultry and paleontology."</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer('B')">B. "Can you tell me more about what culinary experiences impressed you on other planets, and what your group seeks most in galactic cuisine?"</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer('C')">C. "Forget cuisine. Our themed cookware merchandise and cooking shows clearly surpass edible crystals and glowing beverages."</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer('D')">D. "You're wrong there, alien friends! We exclusively eat glowing lunar moss sandwiches and edible diamond soups."</button><br><br>

<h2>Scenario 2: The Cheesy Startup</h2>

<p>Your online exotic cheese startup, "Cheesy Wonders," must compete with traditional local cheese shops. A potential large corporate client, Cheese Sandwich Inc., is reluctant to shift from local suppliers due to concerns about freshness. On your call, they directly express concern:</p>

<p><strong>"Your cheeses look exciting, but we're skeptical about freshness and delivery reliability compared to established local cheese shops. Why risk buying cheeses online?"</strong></p>

<button onclick="selectAnswer2('A')">A. "Freshness? Wait until you see our custom-developed cheese-drones—tiny remote-controlled helicopters that individually deliver cheese directly onto plates!"</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer2('B')">B. "You prefer driving across town in rain and traffic jams to pick up cheese? Evolution clearly favors innovation over inconveniences—do you want to be left behind?"</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer2('C')">C. "Freshness and reliability matter most to you. Would it help if I share detailed data showing our temperature-controlled supply chain and specific logistics processes?"</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer2('D')">D. "Freshness probably isn't even a huge issue; cheese is cheese, and most customers can't tell the difference anyway."</button><br><br>

<div id="answer-response-2"></div>

function selectAnswer2(choice) {
    document.getElementById('answer-response-2').innerHTML = "You selected answer " + choice + ". (We'll add adaptive logic next!)";

<h2>Scenario 3: Celebrity Pet Influencer Agency</h2>

<p>You're showcasing your latest influencer-cat star ("Sir Mittens The Bold") to MegaMilk Dairy, a brand cautiously evaluating celebrity pet endorsements. Their Marketing Director is skeptical and directly says:</p>

<p><strong>"Cats are cute on Instagram, but we're concerned your pet influencer won't clearly meet our strictly regulated dairy-industry marketing guidelines. How could a cat possibly stay compliant with those regulations?"</strong></p>

<button onclick="selectAnswer3('A')">A. "Rules exist mostly on paper. People love animals—Sir Mittens' cuteness clearly overrides minor compliance details. Let's focus more on his engagement numbers."</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer3('B')">B. "Let me ensure I clearly understand your regulatory concerns—could you walk me through the critical compliance rules your brand must meet, and why?"</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer3('C')">C. "Rest assured, Sir Mittens already completed our proprietary 'Pet Regulations Training Program.' Compliance training for animal influencers comes standard in our brand partnership packages."</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer3('D')">D. "If regulations seem problematic, perhaps they're outdated. Why not publicly challenge them, especially backed by a superstar like Sir Mittens?"</button><br><br>

<div id="answer-response-3"></div>

    document.getElementById('answer-response-3').innerHTML = "You selected answer " + choice + ". (We'll add adaptive logic next!)";

<h2>Scenario 4: Sherlock For Hire</h2>

<p>A client worries your freelance detective style is "too energetic and flashy" to fit the structured culture at their formal company. They directly express concern during your call:</p>

<p><strong>"Your energy seems great, but we're an established and formal company—we need someone methodical and orderly. How can we be sure your investigative approach clearly fits our structured way of working?"</strong></p>

<button onclick="selectAnswer4('A')">A. "Strict culture? You're hiring Sherlock Holmes, not a librarian! Flashy is clearly better anyway!"</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer4('B')">B. "That's understandable. Could you clarify specifically the investigative rules and processes that your company considers most essential?"</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer4('C')">C. "Every detective approach comes standard with an AI-generated detective checklist. You'll love the quiet and predictable structure it provides."</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer4('D')">D. "Our agency offers noise-canceling trench coats and whisper-friendly magnifying glasses—perfectly suited to formal and orderly environments."</button><br><br>
