   <h2>Scenario 1: Alien Invasion Negotiation</h2>

<p>Aliens arrive on Earth and are interested—but unsure—about investing in Earth's global culture. They've seen impressive culinary offerings on other planets, like edible crystals and glowing beverages. During initial discussions, your alien contact is skeptical and asks:</p>

<p><strong>"Earth cuisine seems underwhelming. Some planets offer edible crystals and glowing beverages. What culinary advantage could Earth possibly have?"</strong></p>

<button onclick="selectAnswer('A')">A. "Our food might seem ordinary—but we have chicken nuggets shaped like dinosaurs."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="selectAnswer('B')">B. "Can you tell me more about what culinary experiences impressed you on other planets?"</button><br><br>
<button onclick="selectAnswer('C')">C. "Forget cuisine. Our themed cookware merchandise clearly surpasses others."</button><br><br>
<button onclick="selectAnswer('D')">D. "You're wrong. We exclusively eat glowing lunar moss sandwiches."</button><br><br>

<h2>Scenario 2: The Cheesy Startup</h2>

<p>Your online exotic cheese startup, "Cheesy Wonders," must compete with traditional local cheese shops. A potential large corporate client, Cheese Sandwich Inc., is reluctant to shift from local suppliers due to concerns about freshness. On your call, they directly express concern:</p>

<p><strong>"Your cheeses look exciting, but we're skeptical about freshness and delivery reliability compared to established local cheese shops. Why risk buying cheeses online?"</strong></p>

<button onclick="selectAnswer2('A')">A. "Freshness? Wait until you see our custom-developed cheese-drones—tiny remote-controlled helicopters that individually deliver cheese directly onto plates!"</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer2('B')">B. "You prefer driving across town in rain and traffic jams to pick up cheese? Evolution clearly favors innovation over inconveniences—do you want to be left behind?"</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer2('C')">C. "Freshness and reliability matter most to you. Would it help if I share detailed data showing our temperature-controlled supply chain and specific logistics processes?"</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer2('D')">D. "Freshness probably isn't even a huge issue; cheese is cheese, and most customers can't tell the difference anyway."</button><br><br>

        responseArea.innerHTML = `
        <p>You selected B (Better response). You made a confident point! Let's explicitly retest your discovery skills specifically on logistics clearly next (Scenario 2 Question 2B).</p>`;

        responseArea.innerHTML = `
        <p>You selected C (Best response). Excellent! Your client's needs around logistics and freshness are explicitly addressed. Next, we'll dive deeper explicitly into compliance and competitive differentiation (Scenario 2 Question 2A).</p>`;

        responseArea.innerHTML = `
        <p>You selected D (Wrong). This response explicitly disregards client concerns about quality. Let's explicitly correct this misunderstanding next by clarifying explicit freshness and reliability measures clearly (Scenario 2 Question 2D).</p>`;

<h2>Scenario 3: Celebrity Pet Influencer Agency</h2>

<p>You're showcasing your latest influencer-cat star ("Sir Mittens The Bold") to MegaMilk Dairy, a brand cautiously evaluating celebrity pet endorsements. Their Marketing Director is skeptical and directly says:</p>

<p><strong>"Cats are cute on Instagram, but we're concerned your pet influencer won't clearly meet our strictly regulated dairy-industry marketing guidelines. How could a cat possibly stay compliant with those regulations?"</strong></p>

<button onclick="selectAnswer3('A')">A. "Rules exist mostly on paper. People love animals—Sir Mittens' cuteness clearly overrides minor compliance details. Let's focus more on his engagement numbers."</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer3('B')">B. "Let me ensure I clearly understand your regulatory concerns—could you walk me through the critical compliance rules your brand must meet, and why?"</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer3('C')">C. "Rest assured, Sir Mittens already completed our proprietary 'Pet Regulations Training Program.' Compliance training for animal influencers comes standard in our brand partnership packages."</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer3('D')">D. "If regulations seem problematic, perhaps they're outdated. Why not publicly challenge them, especially backed by a superstar like Sir Mittens?"</button><br><br>

<div id="next-step-3"></div>

    } else if(choice === 'B'){
        responseArea.innerHTML = `
        <p>You selected B (Best response). Excellent discovery skills explicitly demonstrated. Next, explicitly differentiate explicitly from lower-cost competitors (Scenario 3 Question 2A).</p>`;
    } else if(choice === 'C'){
        responseArea.innerHTML = `
        <p>You selected C (Better response). Good reassurance, but let's explicitly test further on compliance procedures explicitly next (Scenario 3 Question 2B).</p>`;

        responseArea.innerHTML = `
        <p>You selected D (Good response). Bold and challenging! Explicitly address and clarify comfort level around regulatory concerns next (Scenario 3 Question 2C).</p>`;

<h2>Scenario 4: Sherlock For Hire</h2>

<p>A client worries your freelance detective style is "too energetic and flashy" to fit the structured culture at their formal company. They directly express concern during your call:</p>

<p><strong>"Your energy seems great, but we're an established and formal company—we need someone methodical and orderly. How can we be sure your investigative approach clearly fits our structured way of working?"</strong></p>

<button onclick="selectAnswer4('A')">A. "Strict culture? You're hiring Sherlock Holmes, not a librarian! Flashy is clearly better anyway!"</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer4('B')">B. "That's understandable. Could you clarify specifically the investigative rules and processes that your company considers most essential?"</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer4('C')">C. "Every detective approach comes standard with an AI-generated detective checklist. You'll love the quiet and predictable structure it provides."</button><br><br>

<button onclick="selectAnswer4('D')">D. "Our agency offers noise-canceling trench coats and whisper-friendly magnifying glasses—perfectly suited to formal and orderly environments."</button><br><br>

<div id="next-step-4"></div>

    let responseArea = document.getElementById('next-step-4');

    if(choice === 'A'){

        <p>You selected A (Wrong). Flashy, but explicitly inappropriate for client concern. Explicitly emphasize professional conduct next clearly (Scenario 4 Question 2D).</p>`;
    } else if(choice === 'B'){
        responseArea.innerHTML = `
        <p>You selected B (Best response). Nicely done! Clear discovery explicitly aligning client expectations. Next, explicitly demonstrate reliability methods explicitly (Scenario 4 Question 2A).</p>`;
    } else if(choice === 'C'){
        responseArea.innerHTML = `
        <p>You selected C (Good response). Clearly structured approach, but could use explicitly deeper discovery explicitly next on competitor differentiation (Scenario 4 Question 2C).</p>`;
    } else if(choice === 'D'){
        responseArea.innerHTML = `
        <p>You selected D (Better response). Creative solution explicitly, but lacking explicit detailed discovery explicitly. Let's explicitly clarify client-specific investigative challenges next explicitly (Scenario 4 Question 2B).</p>`;
